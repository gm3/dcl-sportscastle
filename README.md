## ETHDenver Call For Artists
Over the next 6 months, Decentraland will be the primary metaverse we focus on and build in for ETHDenver, EFDevconnect, Sonic Bloom, and other high impact opportunities. Our goal in decentraland is to recreate the main conference building, the Sports Castle, at ETHDenver 2022, highlight, and showcase 100 + featured artists at the official ETHDenver Art Gallery and Auction. Artists can choose a commission from 0 - 100%, with their designated commission going to a beneficiary. This year the commission will go to Gitcoin; to benefit Art focused Public Goods.

Our two calls for artists can be found here: 
* [https://irlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery](https://irlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery)

This year's panel of curators of the gallery have diverse backgrounds, spanning multiple creative initiatives around art and technology. Annie Phillips, of IRL Art, Robert Gray of IRL Art, Shivani Mitra of Museum of Crypto Art, and Jessica Angel of Art Project Decentralized.

In the ETHDenver gallery, we will have decentraland vinyl and printed graphics on a display around a large TV that will host the video with a QR code to visit the parcels. We will provide (2) VR headsets to conference attendees to experience the gallery physically and virtually within Decentraland. The conference will have over 5000 attendees physically, and thousands more can tune in virtually through GamerJibe and our potential Decentraland Gallery.
